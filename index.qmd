## About Me

I teach statistics and data science courses at [Cal Poly Humboldt](https://www.humboldt.edu), California's newest polytechnic university. I hold a Ph.D. in mathematics from UC San Diego, a B.S. in mathematics from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, and an A.S. in mathematics from Bakersfield Community College.

Previously, I taught at the Oregon Institute of Technology and have worked as a statistician at UC San Diego's Clinical and Translational Research Institute, Ghent University (Belgium), and Ume&#229; University (Sweden). 

## Our Campus

**Cal Poly Humboldt** is located on California's Northern Coast, between the Pacific Ocean and redwood forests. This unique setting influences our approach to education, emphasizing hands-on learning, environmental awareness, and community service.

## Teaching and Projects

I'm passionate about helping students develop both theoretical understanding and practical skills that prepare them for thoughtful and rewarding careers. My applied work focuses on "appropriate" uses of computing, e.g. identifying and applying methods that connect available data with research and decision-making needs, with an emphasis on identifying the simplest, most robust approach that works well enough. I'm interested in both causal inference and machine learning
