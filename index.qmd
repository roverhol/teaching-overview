## About Me

I'm an Associate Professor in the [Mathematics Department](https://www.humboldt.edu/mathematics) at [Cal Poly Humboldt](https://www.humboldt.edu), California's newest polytechnic university. Previously, I taught at Oregon Institute of Technology. I have also worked as a statistician at UC San Diego's Clinical and Translational Research Institute, Ghent University (Belgium), and Ume&#229; University (Sweden). I hold a Ph.D. in mathematics from UCSD, a B.S. in mathematics from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and an A.S. in mathematics from Bakersfield Community College.

I'm passionate about helping students develop both theoretical understanding and practical skills that prepare them for thoughtful and rewarding careers.
