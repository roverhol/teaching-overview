# Teaching at Cal Poly Humboldt

## About Me

I'm an Associate Professor in the Mathematics Department at Cal Poly Humboldt, California's newest polytechnic university. My research and teaching focus on applied mathematics, data science, and computational methods.

I'm passionate about helping students develop both theoretical understanding and practical skills that prepare them for careers in data analysis, research, and industry applications.

## Our Campus & Location

**Cal Poly Humboldt** is located in the heart of California's North Coast, surrounded by the majestic coastal redwoods of Humboldt County. Our campus sits between the Pacific Ocean and the towering redwood forests, providing a unique learning environment that inspires both academic excellence and environmental stewardship.

The natural beauty of our location - from the rugged coastline to the ancient redwood groves - serves as a constant reminder of the importance of sustainability and the interconnectedness of natural systems. This setting influences our approach to education, emphasizing hands-on learning, environmental awareness, and community engagement.
